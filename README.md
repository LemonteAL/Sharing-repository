# Sharing-repository

This repository is meant to document the assignments I completed as part of my online coursework
while I was preparing for my transition from grad school to industry. This repository is broken
down by course, then by week / subject in that course, and finally by the assignment itself (as
well as whatever supporting files were necessary for that file to function).
Many of these assignments were done in Jupyter notebooks.
